# angular-provider-test
Project created to test the Angular DI system, using the Providers option to change a class implementation on runtime

The Providers options was tested on the following Angular Features:
- a regular component (report-special)
- Lazy loaded modules (lazyness and external-lazy)


In both cases i successfully changed the instance of the DefaultTooltipGenerator class, injected in the generic-chart component.
